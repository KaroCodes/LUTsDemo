# LUTs Demo

This demo was created for the purpose of sharing knowledge about LUT filtering method including basic color theory.

Here you can find [slides from my presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEtIJSCw4c/E-RtluPx8u3qgkZyajX5gQ/view) that can be used as a guide to navigating this example. In it you will find information about:
- Some color theory
- Constructing a LUT file
- LUT fragment shader overview
- How to make your own?

You can also find an identity LUT png file that you can experiment with.
